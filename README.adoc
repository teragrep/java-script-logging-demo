User Story: As a dev/customer I would like to know how the rlo_08 + rlp_02 do work together in a real application

* Demo web client app sends the HTTP request message (message1) to the node server
* Server uses the RLO_08 library to build the Syslog message including the User Agent details from the Demo web client app and send HTTP response for the demo web client app request
** log the user agent used in the request
* Display the syslog message with rlp_03 example application (https://github.com/teragrep/java-relp-server-demo)
* Use github workflow to setup the environment:
** Launch the rlp_03 for listening data
*** Show logged lines of the rlp_03
** Launch server with rlo_08 and rlp_02
*** RELP Connection should be kept online for sending meaning not connect and disconnect for each message.
** Launch demo web client app
*** Make request
